## 👋 About This Repository

Welcome! This repository serves as a central hub for **Gemini Gems**—custom versions of Google's Gemini AI, tuned with specific instructions and knowledge to perform specialized tasks. 

Whether you need a relentless code reviewer, a whimsical creative writing partner, or a stoic productivity coach, you'll find them here. We believe that prompt engineering is better when shared, and this repo aims to democratize access to high-quality system instructions.

### 📂 How It's Organized
The repository is structured by category. Inside each folder, you will find:
* **`README.md`**: A direct link to use the Gem immediately.
* **`system_instructions.md`**: The raw prompt/system instructions used to build the Gem (so you can tweak it!).
* **`examples.md`**: Example inputs and outputs.

## 🚀 Featured Categories

* **💻 Coding & Engineering:** Debuggers, documentation generators, and architecture critics.
* **✍️ Writing & Content:** SEO optimizers, creative writing coaches, and tone adjusters.
* **📊 Productivity & Ops:** Email drafters, meeting summarizers, and project planners.
* **🎓 Learning & Education:** Socratic tutors, language partners, and concept simplifiers.
